# Stage 3: Minimal runtime image with Chromium.
# Only the compiled binary and entrypoint script are copied in.
#
# Security model:
# - Chrome runs with --no-sandbox (set by entrypoint) because containers don't
#   have user namespaces for sandboxing
# - Container provides isolation via cgroups, seccomp, dropped capabilities,
#   read-only filesystem, and non-root user
# - This matches best practices for headless Chrome in containerized environments

# Chromium and its runtime dependencies for headless operation.
#
# This image is intentionally headless-only: no X11, Wayland, Xvfb, or display
# server packages are installed. Headed mode (a visible browser window) is not
# supported inside this image and PinchTab will refuse / fail to launch headed
# instances here. Keeping the image headless-only keeps it small, CI-friendly,
# and avoids dragging in a graphical stack that has no use in containers.
#
# For manual local headed workflows on a developer workstation see
# docs/guides/headed-mode.md.
